# lambda demo
This is a very simple demo example of lambdas in Java 8. I first started using J8 lambdas in a prototype [vert.x 3](http://vertx.io/) project, and this example is based on something I read at the time but can no longer find. I'm putting lambdas in the context of async callbacks - I came to J8 direct from doing a lot of work in JavaScript so callbacks were a natural way of doing things, and I think that they're a useful way of looking at the subject without getting heavily into streams or functional theory.
